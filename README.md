# biolovision2eBird

[Biolovision2eBird](https://zoziologie.raphaelnussbaumer.com/biolovision2ebird/) helps you to import your bird sightings from any Biolovision website (e.g. [ornitho.ch](https://www.ornitho.ch/), [faune-alsace](https://www.faune-alsace.org/),...) to [eBird](https://ebird.org/)! It is now also possible to convert data from the Observation websites (e.g., [observation.org](observation.org), [waarneming.nl](https://waarneming.nl/),...) and [Birdlasser](https://www.birdlasser.com/).

The process involves the following steps:

1. Generate your data from the original website and load them on this webapp.
2. Create checklists and assign individual sightings to checklist.
3. Provide missing information on checklists to fulfill the eBird standards.
4. Download an [eBird Record Format](https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000907878-upload-spreadsheet-data-to-ebird#anchorRecordFormat) file and upload it to [eBird import tool](https://ebird.org/import/upload.form).
5. The post-processing steps include [fixing species name](https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000907878-upload-spreadsheet-data-to-ebird#anchorCleanData), potentially merging checklist location to hotspot (have a look at [Merge2Hotspot](https://zoziologie.raphaelnussbaumer.com/merge2hotspot/)) and review your checklist for any issues.
